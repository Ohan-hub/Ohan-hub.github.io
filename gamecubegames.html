	<h1>This is my list of Gamecube games in no particular order</h1>
	<p>Cubix: Robots for Everyone - This is a ridiculus game with the most sexual grunts I have ever heard, which is very off putting since I am assuming the player characters are children, though they could be teenagers I'm not really sure. The animations are ridiculous and hilarious. The game is worth playing for those facial animations alone.<br><br>
		
	Custom Robo - This is one of my all time favourite games. It is short and sweet and the story is basic, but keeps me coming back. For most people the gameplay is what draws them in due to the high amount of customization and fast pace robot fights.<br><br>
	
	The Incredibles - This game is kind of butt. I originally got it back in the early 2000s<br><br>
	
	Harry Potter The Prisoner of Azkaban - This was my first "open world" game and it was mind blowing. We got a little taste of how amazing it is to explore Hogwarts in "The Chamber of Secrets" when you got to fly around and collect Burty Bots Every Flavor Beans, and they expanded on that by letting you explore the entire grounds of Hogwarts including the skys whenever you had a free moment.<br><br>
	
	Need for Speed Most Wanted - This is my all time favourite racing game. The race courses while not all that varied in textures and background is very diverse is types of courses. you have simple loops, sharp turns, secret short cuts, sometimes the cops will chase you in the middle of the race there is so much going on and it all blends well with the setting of the game. Outside of the racing the game also offers a very indepth customization feature where you have your choice of car from the shop that include some of the fastest cars ever made and you can customize every single part of the car from stickers to spoilers to the color of your windsheild to the suspension and turbo/supercharger. You actually get more customization options than in "Custom Robo".<br><br>
