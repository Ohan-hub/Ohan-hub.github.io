	In no particular order. My favourite and most played games will be signified by a "*".

	<ul>
		<li>Need For Speed Heat: The best arcade racing game in last 5 years. I am not a fan of Forza and Dirt. Those kinds of games are pretty boring since I do not have a steering wheel. I enjoy the underground street raceing of Need for Speed games that let me customize my car however I like and then have crazy dog fights with the cops. The only thing I didn't really like about this game is the fact that, for some reason, there are more civilians driving at night than during the day. That doesn't make sense.</li>
		<li>Remnant: a souls-like game that incorporates guns. You are in an apocolypse where a hive-mind tree has crossed dimensions and has taken over earth. I am still very early on in the game so I am not that sure about the story or the setting, but that is what I found out about it so far. you can choose from three different "classes". One is a melee class with a shotgun and a hammer and heavy armor</li>
